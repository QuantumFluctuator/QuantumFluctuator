### Hello and welcome to my GitHub!
Here I host various software and tools which I have created in previous years in addition to some forks of projects I found interesting.

My favourite projects:
- [Next Document Manager](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/GSDP-Next-Document-Management) (my third university year group professionalism project)
- [Sorter](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/Sorter) (a fun project made to represent several sorting methods graphically in Java)
- [Bean Machine Simulator](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/Bean-Machine) (a project made in my university Object Oriented Programming module to test C++ heap memory cleanup)
- [Simple Assembly Calculator](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/Simple-Assembly-Calculator) (a simple calculator I made to test my assembly knowledge)
- [FoCA Encrypt](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/FoCA-Encrypt) (an assembly based project made in my Fundamentals of Computer Architecture Module)
- [RSA 'd' Calculator](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/RSA-d-Calculator) (a cross platform capable C++ tool I made to calculate the 'd' value when performing RSA)
- [BlackJack](https://github.com/QuantumFluctuator/Blackjack) (a C# UK Blackjack game which I made using C# and aspects of .NET for my final project at A Level)

I am currently studying MSc Cyber Security with BSI accredited ISO 27001 at Sheffield Hallam University and I am looking to gain experience in the computing field.
